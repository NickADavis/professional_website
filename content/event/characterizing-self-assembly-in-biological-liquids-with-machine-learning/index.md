title: Characterizing self-assembly in biological liquids with machine learning
abstract: Neutron scattering is a powerful experimental technique to
  characterize the molecular structures of biological materials. In this study,
  a machine learning accelerated Bayesian optimization framework for neutron
  scattering analysis is presented in the context of biological materials.
  Parallel Gaussian processes are found to improve the computational efficiency
  of molecular simulations and scattering analysis to enable the study of
  macromolecular biomolecules.

title: "Contributed Talk: Characterizing self-assembly in biological liquids
  with machine learning"
abstract: Wide-angle neutron scattering (WANS) is a powerful experimental
  technique to characterize atomic structures but has not been fully explored in
  biological molecules due to computational constraints. In this study, parallel
  Gaussian processes are shown to improve the computational efficiency of
  neutron scattering analysis algorithms sufficiently to enable the study of
  macromolecular biomolecules. A review of neutron scattering techniques and
  their ability to resolve macromolecular structure and function is also
  discussed.

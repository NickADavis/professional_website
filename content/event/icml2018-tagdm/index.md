  We present an iterative predictor-corrector technique designed to derive
  transferable interatomic potentials from experimental X-ray or neutron
  scattering measurements of monoatomic liquids. The Structure-Optimized
  Potential Refinement (SOPR) approach is supported by structure-potential
  uniqueness theorems for monoatomic dense fluids, and experimental and
  simulation uncertainties are smoothed via non-parametric Gaussian process
  regression. We initially apply the technique to noble

  liquids (Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe), but the results are expected to be generalizable to other monatomic and

  molecular liquids. Interatomic potentials were obtained using experimental scattering measurements at

  a single state where only knowledge of the density and a starting reference potential are required to

  initiate the method. Transferability of the obtained potentials is demonstrated by predicting vapor liquid

  equilibrium over a range of states with acceptable accuracy from the triple to the critical point for the

  test fluids. The results reveal that experimental scattering results provide crucial insight into interatomic

  forces at a length scale complimentary to atomistic or quantum mechanical simulation techniques.

  Furthermore, the transferable potentials obtained using SOPR demonstrate that scattering experiments

  may be utilized to predict thermodynamic properties in physical systems where experimental data is

  unavailable or impractical to obtain.

title: "Contributed Talk: A Bayesian optimized structural force field for noble
  gases enabled by a radial distribution function surrogate model"
abstract: A Bayesian optimized (n-6) Mie force field for noble gases benchmarked
  to experimental neutron diffraction measurements of the radial distribution
  function is presented. The proposed computational approach constructs a
  Gaussian process surrogate model of molecular simulation derived radial
  distribution functions at randomly sampled parameter values. The surrogate
  model approach is found to accelerate Bayesian optimization to experimental
  radial distribution function data from ~1000 CPU years to < 1 CPU hour.
  Transferability of the Bayesian optimized (n-6) Mie force field is confirmed
  with grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations of vapor-liquid equilibrium in
  the noble gases Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe with competitive accuracy to independently
  optimized vapor-liquid equilibrium force fields. This study demonstrates that
  simulated structure accuracy at the sub-angstrom length-scale is achievable
  with machine learning potentials and further that structure-optimized
  potentials are transferable to the prediction of emergent thermodynamic
  behavior.

Neutron/X-ray diffraction measurements can be utilized to quantify many-body interactions at the same length scale as the interatomic interactions. We use a combination of electron structure theory and structure-optimized potential refinement to directly quantify the influence of third- and higher-order effects for real fluid ensembles.

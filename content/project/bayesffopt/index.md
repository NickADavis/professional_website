Structure and self-assembly are complex, emergent properties of matter that are often misrepresented by existing molecular simulation models. Bayesian optimization is an accurate and robust method to create novel force fields based on experimental neutron/X-ray diffraction data to better model the structural behavior of liquid state systems.

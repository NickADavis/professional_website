abstract: Deriving transferable pair potentials from experimental neutron and
  X-ray scattering measurements has been a longstanding challenge in condensed
  matter physics. State-of-the-art scattering analysis techniques estimate
  real-space microstructure from reciprocal-space total scattering data by
  refining pair potentials to obtain agreement between simulated and
  experimental results. Prior attempts to apply these potentials with molecular
  simulations have revealed inaccurate predictions of thermodynamic fluid
  properties. In this Letter, a machine learning assisted structure-inversion
  method applied to neutron scattering patterns of the noble gases (Ne, Ar, Kr,
  and Xe) is shown to recover transferable pair potentials that accurately
  reproduce both microstructure and vaporâ€“liquid equilibria from the triple to
  critical point. Therefore, it is concluded that a single neutron scattering
  measurement is sufficient to predict macroscopic thermodynamic properties over
  a wide range of states and provide novel insight into local atomic forces in
  dense monatomic systems.

abstract: Vegetation classifications on large geographic scales are necessary to inform conservation decisions and monitor keystone, invasive, and endangered species. These classifications are often effectively achieved by applying models to imaging spectroscopy, a type of remote sensing, data, but such undertakings are often limited in spatial extent. Here we provide accurate, high-resolution spatial data on the keystone species Metrosideros polymorpha, a highly polymorphic tree species distributed across bioclimatic zones and environmental gradients on Hawai'i island, using airborne imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR. We compare two tree species classification techniques, support vector machine (SVM) and spectral mixture analysis (SMA), to assess their ability to map M. polymorpha over 28,000 square kilometers where differences in topography, background vegetation, sun angle relative to the aircraft, and day of data collection, among others, challenge accurate classification. To capture spatial variability in model performance, we applied gaussian process classification (GPC) to estimate the spatial probability density of M. polymorpha occurrence using only training sample locations. We found that, while SVM and SMA models exhibit similar raw score accuracy over the test set (96.0% and 93.4%, respectively), SVM better reproduces the spatial distribution of M. polymorpha than SMA. We developed a final 2 m x 2 m M. polymorpha presence dataset and a 30 m x 30 m M. polymorpha density dataset using SVM classifications that have been made publicly available for use in conservation applications. Accurate, large-scale species classifications are achievable, but metrics for model performance assessments must account for spatial variation of model accuracy.

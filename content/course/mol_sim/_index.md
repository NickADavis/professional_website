## Course Overview

Molecular simulations are ubiquitous across a broad range of engineering disciplines, including pharmaceutical development, energy storage technology, and chemical process design. This course introduces undergraduate level engineering students to the fundamentals and applications of molecular simulations. The first half of the course reviews classical thermodynamics and mechanics, leading to an introduction to classical statistical mechanics. Building on these concepts, the second half of the course will focus on molecular simulation techniques, packages, and applications to modern engineering problems.

Final Project
<br>
The final project will be to implement a molecular simulation in HOOMD-Blue on a relevant physical system. The students will propose a hypothesis for a simple system and a computer ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù to test this hypothesis. The instructor will provide guidance on the project starting 5 weeks prior to its due date to allow adequate time for the students to develop a strong final project and analyze the data from their simulations. The students will be expected to give a presentation on their final project in the last two weeks of the semester and will be graded on the quality of their simulations and ability to communicate their work.

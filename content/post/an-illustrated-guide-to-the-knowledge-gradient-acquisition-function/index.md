We provide a short guide to the knowledge-gradient (KG) acquisition
function (Frazier et al., 2009)[^frazier2009knowledge] for Bayesian 
optimization (BO).
Rather than being a self-contained tutorial, this posts is intended to serve as 
an illustrated compendium to the paper of Frazier et al., 2009[^frazier2009knowledge]
and the subsequent tutorial by Frazier, 2018[^frazier2018tutorial], authored 
nearly a decade later.

This post assumes a basic level of familiarity with BO and Gaussian processes (GPs),
to the extent provided by the literature survey of Shahriari et al., 
2015[^shahriari2015taking], and the acclaimed textbook of Rasmussen and Williams, 2006,
respectively.

## Knowledge-gradient

First, we set-up the notation and terminology.
Let $f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$ be the blackbox function we wish to 
minimize.
We denote the GP posterior predictive distribution, or *predictive* for short, 
by $p(y | \mathbf{x}, \mathcal{D})$.
The mean of the predictive, or the *predictive mean* for short, is denoted by
$$
\mu(\mathbf{x}; \mathcal{D}) = \mathbb{E}[y | \mathbf{x}, \mathcal{D}]
$$
Let $\mathcal{D}\_n$ be the set of $n$ input-output 
observations $\mathcal{D}\_n = \\{ (\mathbf{x}\_i, y\_i) \\}\_{i=1}^n$, where
output $y\_i = f(\mathbf{x}\_i) + \epsilon$ is assumed to be observed with noise
$\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.
We make the following abbreviation
$$
\mu\_n(\mathbf{x}) = \mu(\mathbf{x}; \mathcal{D}\_n)
$$
Next, we define the minimum of the predictive mean, or *predictive minimum* for short,
as
$$
\tau(\mathcal{D}) = \min\_{\mathbf{x}' \in \mathcal{X}} \mu(\mathbf{x}'; \mathcal{D})
$$
If we view $\mu(\mathbf{x}; \mathcal{D})$ as our fit to the underlying 
function $f(\mathbf{x})$ from which the observations $\mathcal{D}$ were
generated, then $\tau(\mathcal{D})$ is our estimate of the minimum of $f(\mathbf{x})$,
given observations $\mathcal{D}$.

Further, we make the following abbreviations
$$
\tau\_n = \tau(\mathcal{D}\_n),
\qquad
\text{and}
\qquad
\tau\_{n+1} = \tau(\mathcal{D}\_{n+1}),
$$
where $\mathcal{D}\_{n+1} = \mathcal{D}\_n \cup \\{ (\mathbf{x}, y) \\}$ is the
set of existing observations, augmented by some input-output pair $(\mathbf{x}, y)$. 
Then, the knowledge-gradient is defined as
$$
\alpha(\mathbf{x}; \mathcal{D}\_n) = 
\mathbb{E}\_{p(y | \mathbf{x}, \mathcal{D}\_n)} [ \tau\_n - \tau\_{n+1} ]
$$
Crucially, note that $\tau\_{n+1}$ is implicitly a function of $(\mathbf{x}, y)$,
and that this expression integrates over all possible input-output observation
pairs $(\mathbf{x}, y)$ for the given $\mathbf{x}$ under the
predictive $p(y | \mathbf{x}, \mathcal{D}\_n)$.

### Monte Carlo estimation

Not surprisingly, the knowledge-gradient function is analytically intractable.
Therefore, in practice, we compute it using Monte Carlo estimation,
$$
\alpha(\mathbf{x}; \mathcal{D}\_n) \approx 
\frac{1}{M} \left ( \sum\_{m=1}^M \tau\_n - \tau\_{n+1}^{(m)} \right ),
\qquad
y^{(m)} \sim p(y | \mathbf{x}, \mathcal{D}\_n),
$$
where $\tau\_{n+1}^{(m)} = \tau(\mathcal{D}\_{n+1}^{(m)})$
and $\mathcal{D}\_{n+1}^{(m)} = \mathcal{D}\_n \cup \\{ (\mathbf{x}, y^{(m)}) \\}$.

We refer to $y^{(m)}$ as the $m$th simulated outcome, or the $m$th *simulation*
for short.
Then, $\mathcal{D}\_{n+1}^{(m)}$ is the $m$th simulation-augmented dataset and, 
accordingly, $\tau\_{n+1}^{(m)}$ is the $m$th simulation-augmented predictive minimum.

We see that this approximation to the knowledge-gradient is simply the average 
difference between the predictive minimum values *based on simulation-augmented 
data* $\tau\_{n+1}^{(m)}$, and that *based on observed data* $\tau\_n$, 
across $M$ simulations.

This might take a moment to digest, as there are quite a number of moving parts
to keep track of. To help visualize these parts, we provide an illustration of
each of the steps required to compute KG on a simple one-dimensional synthetic 
problem.

## One-dimensional example

As the running example throughout this post, we use a synthetic function 
defined as
$$
f(x) = \sin(3x) + x^2 - 0.7 x.
$$
We generate $n=10$ observations at locations sampled uniformly at random.
The true function, and the set of noisy observations $\mathcal{D}\_n$ are 
visualized in the figure below:

{{< figure src="figures/observations_paper_1800x1112.png" title="Latent blackbox function and $n=10$ observations." numbered="true" >}}

Using the observations $\mathcal{D}\_n$ we have collected so far, we wish to 
use KG to score a candidate location $x\_c$ at which to evaluate next.

## Posterior predictive distribution

The posterior predictive $p(y | \mathbf{x}, \mathcal{D}\_n)$ is visualized in
the figure below. In particular, the predictive mean $\mu\_n(\mathbf{x})$ is
represented by the solid orange curve.

{{< figure src="figures/predictive_mean_before_paper_1800x1112.png" title="Posterior predictive distribution (*before* hyperparameter estimation)." numbered="true" >}}

Clearly, this is a poor fit to the data and a uncalibrated estimation of the 
predictive uncertainly.

### Step 1: Hyperparameter estimation

Therefore, first step is to optimize the hyperparameters of the GP regression 
model, i.e. the kernel lengthscale, amplitude, and the observation noise variance.
We do this using type-II maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), or *empirical Bayes*.

{{< figure src="figures/predictive_mean_after_paper_1800x1112.png" title="Posterior predictive distribution (*after* hyperparameter estimation)." numbered="true" >}}

### Step 2: Determine the predictive minimum

Next, we compute the predictive minimum $\tau\_n =  \min\_{\mathbf{x}' \in \mathcal{X}} \mu\_n(\mathbf{x}')$.
Since $\mu\_n$ is end-to-end differentiable wrt to input $\mathbf{x}$, we can
simply use a multi-started quasi-Newton hill-climber such as L-BFGS.
We visualize this in the figure below, where the value of the predictive 
minimum is represented by the orange horizontal dashed line, and its location is 
denoted by the orange star and triangle. 

{{< figure src="figures/predictive_minimum_paper_1800x1112.png" title="Predictive minimum $\tau\_n$." numbered="true" >}}

### Step 3: Compute simulation-augmented predictive means

Suppose we are scoring the candidate location $x\_c = 0.1$.
For illustrative purposes, let us draw just $M=1$ sample $y\_c^{(1)} \sim p(y | x\_c, \mathcal{D}\_n)$.
In the figure below, the candidate location $x\_c$ is represented by the 
vertical solid gray line, and the single simulated outcome $y\_c^{(1)}$ is 
represented by the filled blue dot.

In general, we denote the simulation-augmented predictive mean as 
$$
\mu\_{n+1}^{(m)}(\mathbf{x}) = \mu(\mathbf{x}; \mathcal{D}\_{n+1}^{(m)}),
$$
where
$\mathcal{D}\_{n+1}^{(m)} = \mathcal{D}\_n \cup \\{ (\mathbf{x}, y^{(m)}) \\}$
as defined earlier.

Here, the simulation-augmented dataset $\mathcal{D}\_{n+1}^{(1)}$ is the set 
of existing observations $\mathcal{D}\_n$, augmented by the simulated 
input-output pair $(x\_c, y\_c^{(1)})$,
$$
\mathcal{D}\_{n+1}^{(1)} = \mathcal{D}\_n \cup \\{ (x\_c, y\_c^{(1)}) \\},
$$
and the corresponding simulation-augmented predictive mean $\mu\_{n+1}^{(1)}(x)$
is represented in the figure below by the solid blue curve. 

{{< figure src="figures/simulated_predictive_mean_paper_1800x1112.png" title="Simulation-augmented predictive mean $\mu\_{n+1}^{(1)}(x)$ at location $x\_c = 0.1$" numbered="true" >}}

### Step 4: Compute simulation-augmented predictive minimums

Next, we compute the simulation-augmented predictive minimum 
$$
\tau\_{n+1}^{(1)} = \min\_{\mathbf{x}' \in \mathcal{X}} \mu\_{n+1}^{(1)}(\mathbf{x}')
$$
It may not be immediately obvious, but $\mu\_{n+1}^{(1)}$ is in fact also 
end-to-end differentiable wrt to input $\mathbf{x}$. Therefore, we can again 
appeal to an method such as L-BFGS.
We visualize this in the figure below, where the value of the simulation-augmented 
predictive minimum is represented by the blue horizontal dashed line, and its 
location is denoted by the blue star and triangle. 

{{< figure src="figures/simulated_predictive_minimum_paper_1800x1112.png" title="Simulation-augmented predictive minimum $\tau\_{n+1}^{(1)}$ at location $x\_c = 0.1$" numbered="true" >}}

Taking the difference between the orange and blue horizontal dashed line will
give us an unbiased estimate of the knowledge-gradient.
However, this is likely to be a crude one, since it is based on just a single 
MC sample. 
To obtain a more accurate estimate, one needs to increase $M$, the number of 
MC samples.

#### Samples $M > 1$

Let us now consider $M=5$ samples. We draw $y\_c^{(m)} \sim p(y | x\_c, \mathcal{D}\_n)$, 
for $m = 1, \dotsc, 5$. 
As before, the input location $x\_c$ is represented by the vertical solid 
gray line, and the corresponding simulated outcomes are represented by the 
filled dots below, with varying hues from a perceptually uniform color palette
to distinguish between samples.

Accordingly, the simulation-augmented predictive means 
$\mu\_{n+1}^{(m)}(x)$ at location $x\_c = 0.1$, for $m = 1, \dotsc, 5$ are 
represented by the colored curves, with hues set to that of the simulated 
outcome on which the predictive distribution is based.

{{< figure src="figures/bar_paper_1800x1112.png" title="Simulation-augmented predictive mean $\mu\_{n+1}^{(m)}(x)$ at location $x\_c = 0.1$, for $m = 1, \dotsc, 5$" numbered="true" >}}

Next we compute the simulation-augmented predictive 
minimum $\tau\_{n+1}^{(m)}$, which requires minimizing
 $\mu\_{n+1}^{(m)}(x)$ for $m = 1, \dotsc, 5$.
These values are represented below by the horizontal dashed lines, and their 
location is denoted by the stars and triangles. 

{{< figure src="figures/baz_paper_1800x1112.png" title="Simulation-augmented predictive minimum $\tau\_{n+1}^{(1)}$ at location $x\_c = 0.1$, for $m = 1, \dotsc, 5$" numbered="true" >}}

Finally, taking the average difference between the orange dashed line and every
other dashed line gives us the estimate of the knowledge gradient at 
input $x\_c$.

- In this post, we only showed a (naïve) approach to calculating the KG at a 
  given location.
  Suffice it to say, there is still quite a gap between this and being able to 
  efficiently minimize KG within a sequential decision-making algorithm.

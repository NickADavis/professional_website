Kirkwood-Buff solution theory was presented in a landmark paper in 1951. The theory relates particle number fluctuations in the grand canonical ensemble to integrals of the radial distribution function. In this introduction, we will derive Kirkwood-Buff solution theory starting from the definition of the grand canonical ensemble and particle density functions.

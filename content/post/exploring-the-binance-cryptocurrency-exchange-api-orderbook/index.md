In this post, we will explore the live [order book] data on [Binance] through 
its [official API] using Python.

We directly interact with the API endpoints and explicitly make the low-level 
HTTP requests ourselves. If you’re just looking for a high-level way to 
interact with the API endpoints that abstracts away these details please check 
out [python-binance], an unofficial, but slick and well-designed Python Client 
for the Binance API.

We will be making the requests using the [requests] library. 
Thereafter, we will process the results with [pandas], and visualize them 
with [matplotlib] and [seaborn]. Let’s import these dependencies now:

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

To make a GET request for the symbol `ETHBUSD` from the `/depth` endpoint:

```python
r = requests.get("https://api.binance.com/api/v3/depth",
                 params=dict(symbol="ETHBUSD"))
results = r.json()
```

Load the buy and sell orders, or *bids* and *asks*, into respective DataFrames:

```python
frames = {side: pd.DataFrame(data=results[side], columns=["price", "quantity"],
                             dtype=float)
          for side in ["bids", "asks"]}
```

Concatenate the DataFrames containing bids and asks into one big frame:

```python
frames_list = [frames[side].assign(side=side) for side in frames]
data = pd.concat(frames_list, axis="index", 
                 ignore_index=True, sort=True)
```

Get a statistical summary of the price levels in the bids and asks:

```python
price_summary = data.groupby("side").price.describe()
price_summary.to_markdown()
```

| side   |   count |    mean |      std |     min |    25% |     50% |     75% |     max |
|:-------|--------:|--------:|---------:|--------:|-------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| asks   |     100 | 1057.86 | 0.696146 | 1056.64 | 1057.2 | 1057.91 | 1058.49 | 1059.04 |
| bids   |     100 | 1055.06 | 0.832385 | 1053.7  | 1054.4 | 1054.85 | 1055.82 | 1056.58 |

Note that the Binance API only provides the *lowest 100* asks 
and the *highest 100* bids (see the `count` column).

## Top of the book

The prices of the most recent trades will be somewhere between the maximum bid 
price and the minimum asking price. This is known as the *top of the book*. 
The difference between these two price levels is known as the *bid-ask spread*.

```python
>>> frames["bids"].price.max()
1056.58
>>> frames["asks"].price.min()
1056.64
```

We can also get this information from the `/ticker/bookTicker` endpoint:

```python
r = requests.get("https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/bookTicker", params=dict(symbol="ETHBUSD"))
book_top = r.json()
```

Read this into a Pandas Series and render as a Markdown table:

```python
name = book_top.pop("symbol")  # get symbol and also delete at the same time
s = pd.Series(book_top, name=name, dtype=float)
s.to_markdown()
```

|          |    ETHBUSD |
|:---------|-----------:|
| bidPrice | 1056.58    |
| bidQty   |    7.555   |
| askPrice | 1056.64    |
| askQty   |    7.43152 |

## Scatter plot

Let us visualize all the order book entries using a [scatter plot], showing 
*price* along the $x$-axis, and *quantity* along the $y$-axis. 
The hue signifies whether the entry is an "ask" or a "bid".

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.set_title(f"Last update: {t} (ID: {last_update_id})")

sns.scatterplot(x="price", y="quantity", hue="side", data=data, ax=ax)

ax.set_xlabel("Price")
ax.set_ylabel("Quantity")

plt.show()
```

{{< figure src="ETHBUSD/scatter_paper_1650x1020.png" title="Scatter Plot" numbered="true" >}}

This is the most verbose visualization, displaying all the raw information, 
but perhaps also providing the least amount of actionable insights.

## Histogram plot

We can compress this information into a [histogram plot].

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.set_title(f"Last update: {t} (ID: {last_update_id})")

sns.histplot(x="price", hue="side", binwidth=binwidth, data=data, ax=ax)
sns.rugplot(x="price", hue="side", data=data, ax=ax)

plt.show()
```

{{< figure src="ETHBUSD/hist_paper_1650x1020.png" title="Histogram Plot" numbered="true" >}}

This shows the *number* of bids or asks at specific price points, but obscures 
the *volume* (or *quantity*).

This is obviously misleading.
For example, there could be 1 bid at price $p\_1$ and and 100 bids at $p\_2$. 
However, the 1 bid at price $p\_1$ could be for 100 ETH, while each of 
those 100 bids at $p\_2$ could be for just 1 ETH.
At both price points, the *total quantity* of ETH being bid is in fact identical.
Yet this plot would suggest that there is 100 times greater demand for ETH at $p\_2$.

## Weighted histogram plot

This is easy to fix, simply by weighting each entry by the quantity. 
This just amounts to setting `weights="quantity"`:

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.set_title(f"Last update: {t} (ID: {last_update_id})")

sns.histplot(x="price", weights="quantity", hue="side", binwidth=binwidth, data=data, ax=ax)
sns.scatterplot(x="price", y="quantity", hue="side", data=data, ax=ax)

ax.set_xlabel("Price")
ax.set_ylabel("Quantity")

plt.show()
```

{{< figure src="ETHBUSD/hist_weighted_paper_1650x1020.png" title="Weighted histogram plot" numbered="true" >}}

This paints a more accurate picture about supply-and-demand, but still offers
limited actionable insights.

## Weighted empirical CDF (ECDF) plot -- aka the "Depth Chart"

Now we finally arrive at the *depth chart*, which is a popular 
visualization that is ubiquitous across exchanges and trading platforms.
The depth chart is essentially just a combination of two 
[empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF)], or ECDF, plots.

More precisely, they are *weighted* and *unnormalized* ECDF plots. 
As before, they are weighted by the *quantity* and are unnormalized 
in the sense that they are not proportions between $[0, 1]$. 
Rather, they are simply kept as counts. 
Additionally, in the case of *bids*, we take the *complementary* ECDF (which 
basically reverses the order in which the cumulative sum is taken).

In code, this amounts to making calls to `sns.ecdfplot` with the options 
`weights="quantity"` (self-explanatory) and `stat="count"` (to keep the plot
unnormalized). Finally, for the bids, we add the option `complementary=True`. 
Putting it all together:

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.set_title(f"Last update: {t} (ID: {last_update_id})")

sns.ecdfplot(x="price", weights="quantity", stat="count", complementary=True, data=frames["bids"], ax=ax)
sns.ecdfplot(x="price", weights="quantity", stat="count", data=frames["asks"], ax=ax)
sns.scatterplot(x="price", y="quantity", hue="side", data=data, ax=ax)

ax.set_xlabel("Price")
ax.set_ylabel("Quantity")

plt.show()
```

[^fn1]: assuming the order book hasn't changed since we retrieved the data, 
which admittedly is a little unrealistic (a lot can change in a matter of 
milliseconds) but we'll leave that aside for now.

As a highly skilled Registered Nurse, I brought knowledge garnered through diverse critical care settings. My professional journey has taken me into Level 1 Cardiothoracic ICUs, Trauma ICUs, Burn ICUs, and Medical ICUs, where I have finely tuned my abilities to excel in high-stakes scenarios while consistently delivering top-notch patient care.

Dedicated to advancing my knowledge and elevating my practice, I recently attained my Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (AG-ACNPC) degree from Northern Kentucky University.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I am fueled by a passion for adventure and an unwavering commitment to fitness and health. An avid enthusiast of mountaineering, I am currently on a thrilling journey to conquer the seven summits of the world, having already triumphed over two and gearing up for the third at the beginning of the year. This adventurous spirit extends to my dedication to maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle, reflecting my belief in the synergy between physical well-being and professional excellence.

As a highly skilled Registered Nurse, I bring a wealth of experience and expertise cultivated across diverse critical care settings. My professional journey has navigated the dynamic landscapes of Level 1 Cardiothoracic ICUs, Trauma ICUs, Burn ICUs, and Medical ICUs, where I have finely tuned my abilities to excel in high-stakes scenarios while consistently delivering top-notch patient care.

Dedicated to advancing my knowledge and elevating my practice, I recently attained my Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (AG-ACNPC) degree from Northern Kentucky University. The culmination of my AG-ACNPC not only underscores my academic accomplishments but also highlights my unwavering commitment to staying at the forefront of critical care advancements. Eager to continue learning and contribute my extensive knowledge and hands-on experience, I am poised to make a positive impact on patient outcomes, offering compassionate and expert care within the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I am fueled by a passion for adventure and an unwavering commitment to fitness and health. An avid enthusiast of mountaineering, I am currently on a thrilling journey to conquer the seven summits of the world, having already triumphed over two and gearing up for the third at the beginning of the year. This adventurous spirit extends to my dedication to maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle, reflecting my belief in the synergy between physical well-being and professional excellence.

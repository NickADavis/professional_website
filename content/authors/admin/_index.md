As a highly skilled Registered Nurse, I bring a wealth of experience and expertise garnered from diverse critical care settings. My professional journey has led me through the dynamic environments of Level 1 Trauma Centers, Level 1 Burn ICUs, Medical ICUs, and Level 1 Cardiothoracic ICUs, where I have honed my abilities to thrive in high-stakes situations and deliver top-notch patient care.

Committed to advancing my knowledge and elevating my practice, I recently completed my Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (AG-ACNPC) degree at Northern Kentucky University. This intensive program provided a comprehensive academic foundation, augmented by critical care clinical rotations at a Level 1 Teaching Hospital, specifically the esteemed University of Utah Hospital.

The completion of my AG-ACNPC reflects not only my academic achievements but also my commitment to staying at the forefront of advancements in critical care. I am eager to contribute my wealth of knowledge and hands-on experience to make a positive impact on patient outcomes, providing compassionate and expert care in the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare.

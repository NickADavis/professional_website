## CHEM5XXX: Introduction to Statistical Mechanics and Molecular Simulation  

Chemical Engineering 5XXX â€“ Introduction to Statistical Mechanics and Molecular Simulation 

Molecular simulations are ubiquitous across a broad range of chemical engineering disciplines, including pharmaceutical development, energy storage technology, and chemical process design. This course introduces undergraduate level chemical engineering students to the fundamentals and applications of molecular simulations in the chemical industry. The first half of the course reviews classical thermodynamics and mechanics, leading to an introduction to classical statistical mechanics. Building on these concepts, the second half of the course will focus on molecular simulation techniques, packages, and applications to modern engineering problems.

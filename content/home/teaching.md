## CHEM5XXX: Introduction to Statistical Mechanics and Molecular Simulation  

Chemical Engineering 5XXX â€“ Introduction to Statistical Mechanics and Molecular Simulation 

Molecular simulations are ubiquitous across a broad range of chemical engineering disciplines, including pharmaceutical development, energy storage technology, and chemical process design. This course introduces undergraduate level chemical engineering students to the fundamentals and applications of molecular simulations in the chemical industry. The first half of the course reviews classical thermodynamics and mechanics, leading to an introduction to classical statistical mechanics. Building on these concepts, the second half of the course will focus on molecular simulation techniques, packages, and applications to modern engineering problems. 

Course Objectives <br>
-- Review classical mechanics of simple systems <br>
-- Review the fundamentals of classical thermodynamics including the 1st-3rd laws, equations of state, maxwell relations and the fundamental relation <br>
-- Conceptualize how to apply classical mechanics to systems of many-particles <br>
-- Understand entropy from the atomic perspective (Gibbs entropy)<br>
-- Derive basic properties of the microcanonical, canonical, grand canonical, and isothermal-isobaric ensembles <br>
-- Relate the mathematical foundations of statistical mechanics to numerical approaches (i.e. molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods) <br>
-- Learn and implement HOOMD software package for basic molecular simulations <br>
-- Analyze and interpret output data from simulations and connect these results to classical thermodynamics <br>
